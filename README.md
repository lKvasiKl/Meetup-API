All new users have the role _User_.

Register request body:

}
```
### [POST] /Auth/Login
You can use this endpoint to log in and get jwt token.  
Initially, there are two users in the database under whose data you can log in.
1. User with role _User_
  "email": "user@example.com",  
  "password": "string12"
2. User with role _Admin_
  "email": "admin@gmail.com",  
  "password": "12345qwerty"

  "email": "admin@gmail.com",
  "role": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Admin"
  },
  "jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAxLzA0L3htbGRzaWctbW9yZSNobWFjLXNoYTI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJJZCI6IjZlYjRmNTAyLWMxN2MtNDIwMi1hMTk5LWFlMTQxNzFiM2JjYiIsIkVtYWlsIjoiYWRtaW5AZ21haWwuY29tIiwiaHR0cDovL3NjaGVtYXMubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS93cy8yMDA4LzA2L2lkZW50aXR5L2NsYWltcy9yb2xlIjoiQWRtaW4iLCJleHAiOjE2NTY5NTA3MTh9.jVVity3UQwNtX4fqDFoQwS3Lem_JixZTWR7o_E-5wE8"
}
```

After you have received the jwt token, you need copy it and use it for Authorization.
